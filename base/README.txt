
Compatibility:
This JavaScript framework has been tested in IE v7.  Many of the features have also been tested in Firefox 3, however at this time, I can provide no guarantees of functionality outside of the targeted browser, IE v7.  Specifically, the JavaScript has not been tested with IE 6 and may not work correctly in that browser version.  There have been some significant changes from IE 6 to IE 7.


Examples:
In the examples folder you will find examples for most of the main components of this framework.


Documentation:
Each of the JavaScript files contain fairly thorough documentation for the features they provide.  For example, the grid.js file contains documentation for the Grid component.
