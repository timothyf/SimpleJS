== SimpleJS JavaScript Framework

This is a small and easy to use JavaScript framework.

The intent of this framework is not to compete with the larger established JavaScript toolkits such as Dojo, jQuery, or YUI.  For large web projects any of those frameworks would certainly be a better choice than SimpleJS.  However, SimpleJS is a great project to learn how to build your own JS framework or to see how some of these complex tasks are implemented.  One of its strength is that the JavaScript is very well documented through comments that explain each file and function.
